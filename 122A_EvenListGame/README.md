## Problem 6
<p>
You are given an even-length list A consisting of n positive integers. Alice and Bob play a game taking turns alternatively. Alice starts first. In each turn, a player picks either the first or the last element of the current list. After that, that element gets removed, and hence the list gets shorter by one element. Give a strategy in which it is guaranteed that the sum of elements Alice takes is greater than or equal the sum of elements Bob takes. Design a strategy that can be computed in O(n) time. Prove its correctness and analyze its running time.
